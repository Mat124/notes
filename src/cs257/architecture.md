# Processor Architecture

## CPU Organisation & Control

- Processor continuously runs fetch-decode-execute cycle
  - Each instruction cycle take several CPU clock cycles
  - Requires interaction of lots of CPU components
    - ALU, CU, PC, IR, MAR, MDR
  - Machine instructions may specify
    - Op code
    - Source operand reference
    - Result operand reference
    - Next instruction reference
  - Some CPU registers are user-visible, such as data and address registers
  - Control and status registers are used by CU and privileged OS processes only
  - Executing an instruction may involve one or more operands, each requiring to be fetched
    - Can account for this in instruction cycle model known as **indirect cycle**
- Instruction pipelining allows to use wasted time, as new inputs can be accepted before previously accepted instructions and been output
- Control unit is responsbible for generating control signals to drive cycle
  - Observe opcode input and choose right control signal - decode
  - Assert control signals - execute
  - Two approaches to CU design:
    - Hardwired
      - Uses a sequencer and a digital logic circuit that produces outputs
      - Fast but limited by complexity and inflexibility
    - Microprogrammed
      - Uses a microprogram memory
      - Has it's own fetch-execute cycle - mini computer in the CPU
        - Microaddress, MicroPC, MicroIR, microinstructions
      - Easy to design, implement, flexible, can be reprogrammed
      - Slower than hardwired
- Instruction sequencing is important to be designed to utilise as many memory cycles as possible, possibly by overlapping fetches
  - Proper sequence must be followed in sequencing control signals, to avoid conflicts
    - MAR <- PC must precede MBR <- Memory
- Micro-ops are enabled by control signals to transfer data between registers/busses and perform arithmetic or logical operations
  - Each step in the operation of a larger machine instruction is encoded into a micro-instruction
  - Micro-instructions make up the micro-program
  - Micro-program word length is based on 3 factors:
    - The max number of simultaneous micro-ops supported
    - How control info is represented/encoded
    - How the next micro-instruction address is specified
  - Horizontal/direct control has very wide word length with few micro-instructions per machine instruction
    - Outputs buffered/gated with timing signals
    - Fewer instructions == faster
  - Vertical control uses narrower instructions with $n$ control signals encoded into $\log_2 n$ bits
    - Limited ability to express parallelism
    - Requires external decoder to identify what control lines are being asserted

## Performance

- M J Flynn in 1966 defined a simple means of classifying machines, SISD is one such classification
  - Uses fetch-decode-execute
  - Fetch sub-cycle is fairly constant-ish speed
  - Execute sub-cycle may vary in speed greatly
- A simple measure of performance is MIPS, millions of instructions per second
  - Not actually that useful as it measures how fast a processor can do nothing
- Parallel performance is very difficult to measure due to system architecture and degree of parallelism varying
- Instruction bandwith measures the instruction execution rate, similar to MIPS
- Data bandwith measured in FLOPS measures the throughput
- It is nigh-on impossible to get full theoretical throughput in any system, especially parallel
- Speedup is a useful measure that factors in the degree of parallelism
  - $S(n) = $(Execution time on sequential machine, $T(1)$) / (Execution time on parallel machine, $T(n)$)
  - A closeley related measure is efficiency, $E_n = S(n)/n$
  - Both measures depend on parallelism of algorithm
- An algorithm may be characterised by it's degree of parallelism $n_i$, which is the degree of parallelism that exists at time $i$
- Assume all computations are of two types, vector operations of length $N$ and scalar operations where $N=1$
  - $f$ is the total proportion of scalar ops, so $1-f$ is the measure of parallelism in the program
  - $b_v$ is the throughput of vector ops in MFLOPS and $b_s$ is the scalar throughput
    - Average throughput $\frac{1}{b} = \frac{f}{b_s} + \frac{1-f}{b_v}$

## Pipelining

- The problem with an instruction/execute pipeline is contention over memory access
  - Overcome with interleaved memory
- Two possible methods of controlling the transfer of information between pipeline stages
  - Asynchronously using handshake signals
    - Most flexible, max speed determined by slowest stage
  - Synchronously, where there are latches between each stage all synced to a clock
- Example 5-stage I/E pipeline: fetch instruction, decode instruction, fetch operands, execute instruction, store results
- Pipelining assumes the only interaction between stages is the passage of information, but there are 3 major things that can cause hazards and stall the pipeline
  - Structural hazards, resource conflicts where two stages wish to use the same resource, ie a memory port
    - Interleave memory or prefetch data into cache
  - Control hazards occur when there is a change in order of execution of instructions, eg when there is a branch or jump
    - Cause the pipeline to stall and have to refill it
    - Strategies exist to reduce pipeline failures due to conditional branches
      - Instruction pre-fetch buffers, which fetches both branches
        - Complex and rarely used
      - Pipeline freeze strategy, which freezes the pipeline when it receives a branch instruction
        - Simple, but poor performance
      - Static prediction leverages known facts about branches to guess which one is taken
        - 60% of all branches are taken, so may be better to predict this
        - However to not take wastest less pipeline cycles so average performance may be better
      - Dynamic prediction predicts on the fly for each instruction
        - Based on branch instruction characteristics, target address characteristics, and branch history
  - Data hazards, where an instruction depends on the result of a previous instruction that has not yet completed
- Pipeline clock period is determined by the slowest stage, usually execution
  - Pipeline execution unit separately or have multiple execution units
- Sometimes useful to add feedback between stages (recursion), where the output of one stage becomes the input to a previous one
  - Used in accumulation
- Alternative designs are always possible, which come with their own performance tradeoffs
- Space-time diagrams show pipeline usage
  - Efficiency $E_n$ = (busy area)/(total area)
    - Speedup $S(n) = n E_n$
  - More generally, $S(n) =\frac{nN}{N + (n-1)}$
    - $n$ is number of stages, $N$ is instructions executed
    - As $N \to \infty$, $S(n) \to n$
- Complex pipelines with feedback and differently clocked stages can be difficult to design and optimise

  - Reservation tables are space-time diagrams that show where data can be admitted to the pipeline
    - `X`s in adjacent columns of the same row show that stages operate for more than one clock period
    - More than one `X`s in a row not next to each other show feedback
    - Pipelines may not accept initiations at the start of every clock period, or collisions may occur
      - Potential collisions shown by the distance in time slots between `X`s in each row
  - Collision vector is derived from the distance between `X`s
    - $C = C_{n-1} C_{n-2} ... C_2 C_1 C_0$
      - $C_0 = 1$, always
    - $C_i = 1$ if a collision would occur with an initiation $i$ cycles after a previous initiation
    - The initial collision vector is the state of the pipeline after the first initiation
      - Distances between all pairs of `X`s in each row, if distance is $i$ then set bit
  - Need a control mechanism to determine if new initiations can happen without a collision occurring
    - Latency is the number of clock periods between initiations
    - Average latency is the number of clock periods between initiations over some repeating cycle
    - Minimum average latency is the smallest possible considering all possible sequences of initiations
      - The goal for optimum design
    - A pipeline changes state as a result of initiations, so represent activity as a state diagram
      - A diagram of all pipeline states and changes starting with the initial collision vector
      - Shifting the collision vector to the right gives the next state
        - If shifted vector has $C_0 = 1$, cannot initiate
        - If $C_0=1$, then can do new initiation, new vector is bitwise OR of shifted vector and initial vector
      - State diagram can be reduced to show only changes where initiations are taken
        - Numbers on edges indicate number of clock periods to reach the next tate shown
        - Can identify cycles in graph
  - Always taking initiations when $C_0 = 0$, to give minimum latency is the greedy strategy
    - Will not always give minimum average latency but is close
    - Often more than one greedy cycle
    - Average latency for a greedy cycle is less than or equal to the number of 1s in the initial collision vector
      - Gives an upper bound on latency
    - Minimum average latency is greater than or equal to the max number of `X`s in any reservation table row
      - Gives a lower bound on latency
    - Max `X`s in row $<=$ min avg latency $<=$ greedy cycles avg latency $<=$ number of 1s in the initial collision vector
  - A given pipeline may not give the required latency, so insert delays into the pipeline to expand the number of time slots and reduce collisions
  - Can identify where to place delays to give a latency of $n$ cycles: -
    - Start with the first `X`, enter an `X` in a revised table and mark as forbidden every $n$ cycles, to indicate the positions are reserved for initiations
    - Repeat for all `X`s until `X` falls on a forbidden mark, then delay the `X` by one or more
    - Mark all delayed positions and delay all subsequent `X`s by the same amount
  - Delays can be added using a latch to delay by a cycle

Honestly just check the slides and examples for this one it makes zero sense lol

## Superscalar Processors

- A single, linear instruction pipeline provides at very best a steady-state Clocks per Instruction (CPI) of 1
- Fetching/decoding more than one instruction per clock cycle can reduce the CPI below 1
- An easy way to do this is to add duplicate the pipeline
- For example:
  - Two fetch/decode stages
  - Execution staging window register
  - Multiple execution pipelines for different instructions
  - Non-uniform superscalar has pipeline is not duplicated
- Number of replications before window is the **degree** of the superscalar processor
- Some pipeline stages need less than half a clock cycle, so double internal clock speed can get two tasks done per half a clock cycle
  - Known as **superpipelining**
- A pipeline takes $s + N -1 $ clock cycles to execute $N$ instructions
  - A superscalar pipeline takes $s + \frac{N-1}{\sigma}$ to do the same
- An example pipeline has 4 stages, fetch, decode, execute, write-back
  - Each stage is duplicated
    - $\sigma=2$, the number of replications
    - $s=4$, the number of stages
  - If instructions are aligned, the number of clocks required if $s + (N/\sigma) -1$
  - If instructions are unaligned, then $s + (N/\sigma)$
- The CPI of a superscalar processor is $1/\sigma + 1/N(s- 1/\sigma)$
- For large values of $\sigma$, the speedup is limited by delays set by $N$ and pipeline length $s$
- As $\sigma$ increases, speedup increases linearly too until the point where instruction level parallelism limits further increases
  - For many problems, ILP gives parallelism in the range 2-4x
- No reason to have a huge number of duplicated pipelines, as most programs have a limited degree of inherent parallelism
  - Can be maximised by compiler and hardware techniques
  - Limited by dependencies
- The program to be executed is a linear stream of instructions
  - Instruction fetch stage includes branch prediction to form a dynamic stream which may include dependencies
  - Processor dispatches instructions to be executed according to their dependencies
  - Instructions are conceptually put back into sequential order and results recorded - known as committing or retiring the instruction
    - Needed as instructions are executed out of order
    - Instruction may also be executed speculatively and not need to be retired

## Instruction Level Parallelism

- Common instructions can be initiated simultaneously and executed independently
- Superscalar processors rely on this ability to execute instructions in separate pipelines, possibly out-of-order
  - Multiple functional units for multiple tasks
- ILP refers to the degree to which instructions can be executed in parallel
- Common techniques to exploit it include instruction pipelining and superscalar execution, but also:
  - Out-of-order execution
  - Register renaming
    - Values conflict for use of the registers, processor has to stall to resolve conflicts
    - Can treat the problem as a resource conflict, and dynamically rename registers in hardware to reduce dependencies
    - Use different registers to the ones that the instructions say
  - Branch prediction
    - Prefetch both sides of the branch, reduces delay
    - Can be static or dynamic
    - Speculative execution aims to do the work before it is known if results will be needed
      - Relies on resource abundance to provide performance improvements
- Fiver factors fundamentally constrain ILP:
  - True data dependency
    - An instruction cannot execute because it requires data that will be produced by a preceding instruction
    - Usually causes pipeline delays
  - Procedural dependency
    - Inherent to the sequential nature of execution
    - Instructions following a branch have a dependency on the result of the branch
    - Variable length instructions can prevent simultaneous fetching
  - Resource conflicts
    - Two or more instructions require a system resource at the same time
    - Memories, caches, functional units, etc
- A program may not always have enough inherent ILP to take advantage of the machine parallelism
  - Limited machine parallelism will always inhibit performance
  - Processor must be able to identify ILP
- Instruction issue refers to the process of initiating execution in the processors functional units
  - Instruction has been issued once it finishes decoding and hits first execute stage
  - The instruction issue policy can have a large performance impact
  - Three types of instruction order are significant:
    - Fetch order
    - Execute order
    - Order in which instructions update the contents of memory
  - Issue policy can fuck with these orders to whatever extent it pleases provided the results are correct
- Three general categories for instruction issue policies:
  - In-order issue with in-order completion
    - Do the same as what would be done by a sequential processor
      - Issuing stalls when there is a conflict on a functional unit or takes more than one cycle
  - In-order issue with out-of-order completion
    - A number of instructions may be being executed at any time
    - Limited by machine parallelism in functional unites
    - Still stalled by resource conflicts and dependencies
    - Introduces output dependencies
  - Out-of-order issue with out-of-order completion
    - In-order issue will only decode up to a dependency or conflict
    - Further decouple decode and execute stages
    - A buffer - the instruction window - holds instructions after decode
    - Processor can continually fetch/decode as long as window not full and execution is separate
    - Increases instructions that are available to execution unit
